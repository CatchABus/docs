The `app.css` (or `app.scss`) file contains the global styles for the app. The name of the file is important, since this file is automatically loaded when the app starts.

## Platform specific styles

Platform specific styles can be defined in `app.<platform>.(css|scss)`

## Using other CSS plugins

You can use any number of CSS plugins you'd like in your project.

For example, you can use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using [@nativescript/tailwind](https://github.com/NativeScript/tailwind#nativescripttailwind)
